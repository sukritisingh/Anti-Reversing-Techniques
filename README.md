# Anti-Reversing-Techniques

Anti-reversing techniques are techniques deployed which are meant to make the reverse engineering process difficult for a hacker or any malicious user. The main goal of various anti-reverse engineering techniques is simply to complicate the process of reversing as much as possible. An attacker can use the disassembly of a binary in order to get an insight of the logic of the code as well as reverse engineer their way into getting crucial information. 

In this project, if we try to understand some anti-reversing techniques in order to make our binaries difficult to crack and make as less exploitable as possible.
